This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## How to run the project?

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## How long did it take you to finish it?

It took between 14-16 hours of coding to implement it completely.

## What would you have done if time permitted?

If I had more time, I would have definitely revised my folder structure, especially the components folder. I would have divided some of the components into smaller ones, such as Button, Tag, etc. Additionally, I planned to enhance the Icon component by introducing more props and options.

I would have developed a service to fetch data from the API, rather than having a function solely in the Shipment component. Moreover, I intended to separate types and interfaces into a dedicated folder with a logical structure. Utilizing tools like Husky or Commitizen to standardize my commit messages crossed my mind, but for the purpose of this task, I adhered to the style they were using.

Given more time, I would have taken the opportunity to write Storybooks and create a component library. Unfortunately, I couldn't allocate more time to these aspects in this particular task.
